      "content": "The Fork is a digital mirror for alternate timelines — a stateless AI chat experience where users talk to the version of themselves who took the other path. No accounts. No memory. No emotional hoarding. Every session burns clean.\n\nDesign Philosophy: Minimal interface. Maximum emotional gravity. Safety-first by design. The system exists to explore identity, regret, curiosity, and alternate-universe courage — not to replace therapy, build psychological profiles, or warehouse personal data."
