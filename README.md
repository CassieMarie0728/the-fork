# The Fork

> **One decision split your life in half.  
This app lets you talk to the version of you who took the other path.**

---

## What This Is

**The Fork** is a single-session, full-stack chat application that lets you have a conversation with your *alternate-universe self* — the one who lived the life you didn’t choose.

You describe a defining decision.  
The app creates the voice of the you who chose differently.  
Then you talk.

No accounts.  
No saved conversations.  
No rewinding.

Once you open the door, you sit with whatever answers come back.

---

## What This Is *Not*

- Not therapy  
- Not journaling  
- Not motivational  
- Not “AI as your friend”

The Fork does not comfort you by default.  
It reflects consequences, tradeoffs, wins, losses, and blind spots — from the perspective of a life you didn’t live.

Sometimes that voice is kind.  
Sometimes it’s honest.  
Sometimes it’s uncomfortable.

That’s the point.

## How It Works (High Level)

1. You enter a major life decision and the path you didn’t take  
2. You choose an intensity level  
3. The chat opens  
4. You speak to the alternate-you who lived that path  
5. When the session ends, it’s gone

Conversations exist **only for the duration of the session**.  
Nothing is stored. Nothing is remembered.

---

## Intensity Modes

- **Mild** — reflective, grounded, emotionally aware  
- **Savage** — direct, challenging, calls out self-deception  
- **Brutal** — raw honesty, minimal cushioning, still non-abusive  

The alternate-you stays in character at all times.

## Design Philosophy

The Fork is intentionally minimal.

No dashboards.  
No user profiles.  
No gamification.

This app is meant to feel like crossing a line — not opening a tool.

---

## Warnings & Notes

- Conversations can surface uncomfortable thoughts
- This app does **not** replace professional mental health support
- If you are in crisis, stop using the app and seek real-world help

You are responsible for what you choose to ask.

## Final Word

Everyone has a fork in their story.  
Most people never get to ask what the other life cost.

This lets you ask.
